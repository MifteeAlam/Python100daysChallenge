'''                  100 days python Challenge
Day 11	Control Structures - While Loops	Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.'''


# Initialize the variable to start from 1
num = 1  

# Use a while loop that runs as long as num is less than or equal to 10
while num <= 10:  
    # Print the current value of num
    print(f"Current number: {num}")  
    
    # Increment num by 1 to move to the next number
    num += 1  

# After the loop ends, print a message indicating completion
print("Loop has finished. All numbers from 1 to 10 have been printed.")
